Class : AjaxTreeview

AjaxTreeview class fetches data from datatable for the requested parent category id. The data is then stored in array and converted into JSON format. This JSON format is then used by javascript code for populating tree view. JSON ( Javascript Object Notation ) is used as transitional language though XML based version is also available. JSON is used to make processing fast as compared to XML. For component AjaxTreeview JSON support must be available on server side. The component is multibrowser, cross database, cross server side language, fast, flexible and is very easy to implement.
